## [Unreleased]

## [2026-07-18] — full-text-first migration

### Changed

- All state-authored documents in this knowledge body migrated to the full-text-first
  content policy: complete verbatim source text now lives under each file's
  `## Full text` section (generated from the committed source snapshots; page furniture
  stripped and recorded in `conversion_notes`); inline [VERBATIM]/[SUMMARY] tags retired;
  curator content confined to At a glance / Curator notes / Cross-references;
  `content_mode: verbatim`. Source hashes unchanged (snapshots were fetched 2026-07-17/18;
  not re-fetched). CI now verifies every full-text line against the snapshot in order,
  plus a completeness coverage check.

## [2026-07-17]

### Added

- ors-276a.300, ors-276a.303, ors-276a.306 (2025 Edition): initial ingest from the
  chapter 276A HTML (shared snapshot ors-chapter-276a.html, sha256 b4adecc9…).
  Verified-by @morficflux.
